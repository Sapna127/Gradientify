# Perks 

- This project provides a user interface that allows users to select colors, a gradient direction, and a border thickness for a CSS box.
- The project generates the corresponding CSS code for the box based on the user's input and displays it on the screen.
- Users can copy the CSS code to their clipboard with the click of a button.
- This project uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for efficient and scalable development.
- The code is modularized and organized in separate components, which makes the project more maintainable and easier to work on collaboratively.
- The project uses modern JavaScript features like destructuring assignment and template literals to make the code more concise and readable.
- The code uses error handling to prevent the program from crashing in case of user input errors or unexpected errors during runtime.
